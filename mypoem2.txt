Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Admit impediments; love is not love 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
That looks on tempests and is never shaken; 
t is the star to every wand’ring bark, 
Whose worth’s unknown, although his heighth be taken. 
Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his bending sickle’s compass come; 
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. 
If this be error and upon me proved, 
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
Let me not to the marriege of true minds 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Admit impediments; love is not love 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
It is the ster to every wand’ring bark, 
Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Admit impediments; love is not love 
Admit impediments; love is not love 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
bends with the remover to remove: 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark, 
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark,
